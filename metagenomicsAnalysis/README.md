Identification of the types and abundances of the microbial species living on the human body is important for understanding the interactions of these microorganisms among themselves and with the host. A change or difference in the composition of the microbiome has been implicated in a number of diseases.

The goal of this pipeline is to analyze a (hypothetical) sample from oral cavity and identify the species and abundances of the bacteria and given the short reads obtained from Next-Gen sequencing of the sample. The data used for this assignment was extracted/adapted from the publication "Next generation sequencing data of a defined microbial mock community"

The data used here has been been manipulated and should not be used to draw any scientific conclusions.
